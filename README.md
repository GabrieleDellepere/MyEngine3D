# MyEngine3D
I'm onto this little project of mine to create a 3d engine from scratch. 
For this, I'm using OneLoneCoder Engine to be able to write on a Windows console with ascii characters as if they were pixels.
It isn't the optimal strategy, since this causes the rendering to be very laggy, but if I wanted to produce something serious 
I could always port the code with an actual GUI library, for now I'm seeing this as a mere coding challenge.
